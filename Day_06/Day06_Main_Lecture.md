# 📚 Topic 1: The Problem — Why Raw Queries Fail

## 🔴 Problem — The Illusion of Mind Reading

When beginners use Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Gemini, they treat them like search engines or mind readers. They write simple queries and expect perfect, production-grade outputs.

**Example 1: The "Write a post" failure**

- *Query:* "Write a LinkedIn post about prompt engineering."
- *LLM Output:* A generic, emoji-stuffed, overly corporate, and boring post that sounds exactly like a robot wrote it.
- *Why it failed:* The LLM has no context. It doesn't know who you are, who your audience is, what tone you want, or what formatting style to use. It guessed the "average" LinkedIn post, which is generic.

**Example 2: The "Math reasoning" failure**

- *Query:* "A store sells apples. On Monday, they sell 10 apples. On Tuesday, they sell double Monday's amount. On Wednesday, they get a shipment of 50 apples but 5 are rotten. They sell 15. How many apples do they have left if they started with 100 on Monday morning?"
- *LLM Output:* Frequently incorrect calculations or jumps to the wrong final number.
- *Why it failed:* LLMs generate text token-by-token. If you force them to answer immediately, they don't allocate "computational thinking steps" to solve the problem before writing the answer.

## 🏗️ What is Prompt Engineering?

### Definition

**Prompt Engineering** is the practice of structured communication with an LLM to steer its behavior, reasoning, and output format toward a desired goal without updating its weights (no fine-tuning).

### The Core Principle

**Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO).** The quality of an LLM's output is directly proportional to the clarity, context, and structural constraints of the input prompt.

# 📚 Topic 2: Zero-Shot vs. One-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting

## 📖 Theoretical Breakdown

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  PROMPTING TECHNIQUES                  │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┤
│    Zero-Shot     │     One-Shot     │     Few-Shot     │
│  - No examples   │  - 1 example     │  - 3+ examples   │
│  - Rely on LLM   │  - Shows format  │  - Shows pattern │
│    prior knowledge│    and style    │    and edge cases│
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
```

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

You ask the LLM to perform a task without giving it any examples of the expected input and output.

- **When to use:** Simple tasks, standard translation, common reasoning, or when testing baseline LLM capabilities.
- **Example:**
  ```text
  Classify the sentiment of this text: "I absolutely love this new keyboard!"
  Sentiment:
  ```

### 2. One-Shot Prompting

You provide exactly **one** completed example of the task to demonstrate the desired format, style, or structure.

- **When to use:** When you need the LLM to follow a specific output schema or voice.
- **Example:**
  ```text
  Input: "The weather today is rainy."
  Output: 🌧️ Rainy

  Input: "The sun is shining brightly."
  Output:
  ```

### 3. Few-Shot Prompting

You provide **multiple (typically 3 to 5)** examples of inputs and their corresponding correct outputs.

- **When to use:** Complex tasks, classification with custom labels, maintaining extreme style consistency, or teaching the model a novel pattern.
- **Example:**
  ```text
  Text: "I got a promotion today!" -> Category: Career Progress
  Text: "My server crashed and lost all data." -> Category: Tech Incident
  Text: "Signed a contract with a new enterprise client." -> Category: Sales Win
  Text: "We need to fix the alignment on the login button." -> Category:
  ```

# 📚 Topic 3: Role Prompting

## 📖 Giving the LLM a Persona

LLMs are trained on a massive web of diverse data, ranging from medical journals to reddit comments. If you do not constrain their role, they will draw from the "average" of all web content.

**Role Prompting** instructs the LLM to adopt a specific professional profile, background, and set of constraints.

### How it works:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 WITHOUT ROLE PROMPTING                 │
│ User Prompt ────► [ LLM General Knowledge ] ────► Output│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  WITH ROLE PROMPTING                   │
│ System/Role Prompt ──┐                                 │
│                      ▼                                 │
│ User Prompt ────► [ LLM: Staff copywriter ] ────► Output│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Bad Role Prompt:** "Act as a writer."
- **Production-Grade Role Prompt:** "You are a Senior Copywriter at a top-tier tech publication with 10+ years of experience writing for startup founders. Your tone is direct, analytical, and punchy, avoiding corporate jargon."

# 📚 Topic 4: Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting

## 🧠 Forcing the LLM to Reason Step-by-Step

If you ask a human to solve a complex math problem, they write steps on paper. If you force them to say the final answer instantly, they make mistakes.
LLMs suffer from the same limitation. **Chain of Thought (CoT)** prompting solves this by prompting the model to output its intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at the final answer.

### The Trigger Phrase

Simply appending `"Let's think step-by-step:"` or `"Write down your reasoning steps before giving the final answer"` forces the model to allocate tokens to calculation.

```
Standard Prompting:
Input: [Question] ────► [ LLM Instant Answer ] (High Error Rate)

Chain of Thought:
Input: [Question] ────► [ Reason Step 1 ] ➔ [ Reason Step 2 ] ➔ [ Final Answer ]
```

# 📚 Topic 5: ReAct Prompting (Reasoning + Acting)

## 🔄 The Bridge to Autonomous Agents

In Day 6, we touch on the **ReAct** prompting pattern. ReAct allows the model to alternate between reasoning ("Thought") and using tools ("Action" ➔ "Observation").

### The ReAct Prompt Structure:

```text
Question: [The user query]
Thought: [Reasoning about what to do next]
Action: [The tool to call, e.g., SearchWeb[query]]
Observation: [The result of the tool run]
Thought: [Reasoning based on the observation]
... (Repeat until solved)
Final Answer: [The ultimate response]
```

ReAct is implemented by writing a strict system prompt that instructs the LLM to write in this exact parser-friendly format.

# 📅 Day 6 Assignment Brief: LinkedIn Post & Email Generator

Students will build two production-grade tools:

1. **LinkedIn Post Generator:** A CLI tool that takes a topic, role, and few-shot templates to write viral, structured tech posts.
2. **Email Generator:** A CLI tool that uses role prompting and CoT to write high-converting professional cold emails and follow-ups.

Both projects must handle environment configs and use direct LLM API calls with zero-shot, few-shot, and role-based prompt templates.
